# SimpleCalculator

# Remaining Items: 
* Diagnostics interface
* Testing of Diagnostics interface
* SQL Server Schema
* Prime Number Functionality
* There are some code improvement todos scattered in the codebase as well.

# To Run Front End Project
* make sure to have npm install.
* open a console in the front end project folder and run 
`npm i` 
to install necessary packages.
* `npm run serve` will start the front end server locally.
* if your backend server runs locally on a different port than 44325 (or is hosted elsewhere) then it will be necessary to change the proxy target in the vue.config.js file to match the address of where your project runs to run the development build and avoid CORS issues.
